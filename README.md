# C++ Programs: Conditional Statements and Grading Logic

## Overview

This document provides a theoretical explanation of three beginner-level C++ programs that showcase conditional decision-making. The focus is on calculating averages, determining letter grades, and classifying numbers by their sign (positive, negative, or zero). These examples reinforce essential skills such as user input, performing arithmetic, and applying if, else if, and else statements for flow control.

## Program 1: Grade Determination Using Average Marks

### Purpose
This program computes the average of marks scored in three subjects and assigns a grade based on that average.

### Key Concepts
- Input Handling: Reads marks for three subjects via standard input.
- Arithmetic Operations: Calculates the average with basic math.
- Conditional Logic: Employs multiple if-else if-else branches to assign the correct grade.
- Character Variable: Grade is saved as a single character like 'A' or 'B'.

### Logic Outline
- User enters three floating-point numbers as marks.
- The average is calculated from these three numbers.
- Conditional logic assigns the grade as follows:
  - A: 90 or above
  - B: 80 to 89
  - C: 70 to 79
  - D: 60 to 69
  - F: less than 60
- The program outputs both the computed average and the grade.

### Output:
Enter marks for 3 subjects: 32,65,76  
Average: 10.6667%  
Grade: F  

## Program 2: Number Sign Classification

### Purpose
This program checks whether the given integer is positive, negative, or zero using conditional branching.

### Key Concepts
- Input Handling: Receives an integer from the user.
- Conditional Statements: Uses if-else if-else structures to determine the number's sign.
- Output Display: Shows a message based on the classification.

### Logic Outline
- User inputs an integer.
- The program checks:
  - Positive if value is above zero,
  - Negative if value is below zero,
  - Zero if the value equals zero.
- Displays the result accordingly.

### Output:
Enter a number: 4  
The number is positive  

## Program 3: Duplicate of Grade Calculator

### Purpose
This program repeats the logic of the first program, recalculating averages and grades. It is used for additional practice or demonstration.

### Output:
Enter x: 54  
Enter y: 64  
1st quadrant  

## Conclusion

These C++ programs provide a strong starting point for understanding conditional logic. They help students:

- Gather and handle user input.
- Compute results using arithmetic expressions.
- Apply conditional logic to make decisions.
- Output results based on condition checks.

Such elementary programs establish the groundwork for solving real-world problems using basic control flow and logical structures.
